### Procedural Programming
Procedural Programming (PP) – "Step-by-Step Approach"
Think of it like following a recipe: You give instructions one by one, and they execute in order. It uses functions and variables that can change (mutable state).

### Functional Programming
Functional Programming (FP) – "Math-Like Approach"
Instead of changing variables, it focuses on pure functions (functions that always return the same result for the same input). It avoids modifying data and prefers map, filter, and recursion over loops.

- **Pure Functions – "No Side Effects"**
A pure function is a function that:<br>
✅ Always returns the same output for the same input.<br>
✅ Does not modify global variables or change external state.<br>
✅ Has no side effects (e.g., no printing, no file/database changes).<br>
