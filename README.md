1. Numeric
    - Integer
    - Float
    - Complex Number
2. Sequence
    - String
    - List
    - Tuples
3. Dictionary
4. Boolean
5. Set

### Procedural Programming
Procedural Programming (PP) – "Step-by-Step Approach"
Think of it like following a recipe: You give instructions one by one, and they execute in order. It uses functions and variables that can change (mutable state).

### Functional Programming
Functional Programming (FP) – "Math-Like Approach"
Instead of changing variables, it focuses on pure functions (functions that always return the same result for the same input). It avoids modifying data and prefers map, filter, and recursion over loops.

- **Pure Functions – "No Side Effects"**
A pure function is a function that:<br>
✅ Always returns the same output for the same input.<br>
✅ Does not modify global variables or change external state.<br>
✅ Has no side effects (e.g., no printing, no file/database changes).<br>

### OOP - 
OOP is a programming paradigm that structures code into objects with data and methods, following
1. *Encapsulation* → Hides data inside a class, allowing access only through defined methods.
- Public: Can be accessed anywhere (inside or outside the class).
- Protected: Can be accessed within the class and subclasses (not strictly enforced).
- Private: Cannot be accessed directly outside the class (uses name mangling).
2. *Abstraction* → Hides complex details, showing only essential features.
3. *Inheritance* → Allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
- Single Inheritance → One child class inherits from one parent class.
- Multiple Inheritance → A child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
- Multilevel Inheritance → A child class inherits from a parent, which itself is a child of another class.
- Hierarchical Inheritance → Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent.
- Hybrid Inheritance → A mix of multiple inheritance types.
4. *Polymorphism* → Enables the same function to work differently for different objects.

### Module, Pakage & Library
1. **Module**: A single file containing related code (e.g., functions, classes).
2. **Package**: A collection of modules organized in a directory (may include __init__.py).
3. **Library**: A collection of reusable code (modules or packages) for common tasks.
